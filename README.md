# Digital Negative

A header-only C library for decoding Adobe DNG files.

## Goals

* Use descriptive names.
* Have decent performance.
* Support "baseline" Tiff 6.0.
* Decode into a straightforward, encoding-neutral representation that's easy to interact with.

## Status

Currently working through baseline Tiff 6.0 specification (subset of DNG specification).
